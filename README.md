# Lost Synagogues of Detroit

# Project Background

In August 2019, I moved into my first adult apartment on Holbrook Avenue in Detroit's North End. I moved to Detroit to work for a startup as a part of Venture for America. I signed my lease to move into my apartment on a Thursday, because my first day of work was the following Monday and I had no roommate. The apartment was cheap enough for me to afford living alone. I signed it 30 minutes after viewing it, which is not something I recommend.

Down the street was a church that curiously had Hebrew letters on it and an inscription that read "Cong Ahavath Zion." The church, however, was called Alpha and the Omega. I Googled the congregation's name and stumbled upon Shtetlhood, a website documenting the numerous former synagogues in Detroit. I went down a rabbit hole of reading about them all and the Jewish history in Detroit, which at the time I was living there was (and is) a majority Black city with almost no Jewish residents. Detroit's Jewish residents moved to the suburbs along with many of the white residents, leaving behind many places of worship that were used as churches by the city's remaining (mostly Black) residents. To learn more about the changing demographics of Detroit, I recommend The Origins of the Urban Crisis by Thomas J. Sugrue. Another book that looks good, but I haven't yet read, is Metropolitan Jews by Lila Corwin Berman.

In January 2023, I wanted to learn more about data visualization, and Leaflet.js was a library that was frequently cited in job descriptions. Since I already had an interest in this website, I decided to remake the (static) website as an interactive Leaflet.js app.
