# Lost Synagogues of Detroit

# Overview

This application displays the items from [this map](https://www.shtetlhood.com/map.htm) in an interactive format. It pulls from a .csv, and uses Leaflet.js for the map. The data was taken from [Shtetlhood](https://www.shtetlhood.com/index.html).

# Project Background

I learned about Shtetlhood when I moved to Detroit in the fall of 2019. My first apartment was in Detroit's North End, which was a neighborhood that had many Jewish residents in the 1930s and 40s. Since then, the neighborhood demographics have changed and there are very few Jewish residents. As a result, many of the old synagogues and community centers have been repurposed, in many cases becoming churches. One such church (The Alpha and Omega Church, originally built as Congregation Ahavath Zion) was down the street from me. I started reseraching the history of the church, and found that website. 

I wanted to improve upon the map, which wasn't interactive. Thus, this project was born.

# Methodology

## Scraping the data

## Geocoding it

## Reading it into Leaflet.js

# Next steps

Here are some things I'd like to do with this project:

* Add custom icons for the synagogues and institutions
* Update the styling to resemble the origin map
* Expand this map to include other places of worship
